<p>This paper by Miles Lubin at MIT really demonstrates the ability of these macros to reduce general overhead and waste for IP/MIP. I&rsquo;d really recommend a read, if you&rsquo;re interested in math programming. The more I learn about this language, the more I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s posed, from an infrastructural perspective, to replace <em>at least </em>R. But, then again, I&rsquo;m not getting my degree in telling futures to the present.</p>
