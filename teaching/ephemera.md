This is where I'll dump some material I use or refer to for teaching purposes. 


#### writing 
Jim Hodges, at UMN, has some great advice on common constructions used in technical writing that take up a surprising amount of space, and how these can be replaced with simpler, clearer, or more direct alternatives. [It starts on page 7](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~hodges/UseInsp/HandoutOnWriting.pdf)

#### statsistics
Jim Hodges also has a pretty cogent, understandable little discussion of the [logic and reasoning behind permutation tests.](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~hodges/UseInsp/PermutationTests.pdf)
