<p><em>Levi John Wolf</em>, <em>Alison Heppenstall</em>, and <em>Rich Harris</em></p>
<p>We invite you to participate in <em>A Research Agenda for Spatial Analysis</em>, a collection of (approximately) by writing a 5000 word perspective on the future of your area by 31 January, 2022.</p>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Back to Berry and Marble&rsquo;s early <em>Spatial Analysis</em> handbook, handbooks in quantitative geography or spatial analysis have provided a venue to take a snapshot of our field as it is. And, while they are produced often, it is both an honor and a rare opportunity to contribute to these <em>Handbooks.</em> More rare than this, however, are opportunities to <em>envision a future for spatial analysis.</em></p>
<p>In this edited volume, <em>A Research Agenda for Spatial Analysis</em>, we invite you to stake a claim on the future of spatial analysis. Think of this as a &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; for the future of your topic. These short chapters (approximately 5000 words, about as long as a <em>Progress in Human Geography</em> &ldquo;Progress Report&rdquo;) are intended to be clear, opinionated, and speculative perspectives on the future of a concept or a domain of practice in spatial analysis.</p>
<p>The edited volume will be split into two halves. In the first part, we invite researchers to reflect on the future of &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo; or &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; that have been central to their research agenda, as well as any <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132519826684">classics that weren&rsquo;t</a>: concepts, books, or papers that have been particularly influential in your thinking but that are not quite as prominent as the ought to be. The second half of <em>RASA</em> will be composed of essays from a variety of scholars who will write about their chosen domain of expertise. In both cases, we are looking for brief but clear-eyed statement of where you think the field is going for your chosen concept or topic.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h4 id="when-is-the-due-date"><em>When is the due date?</em></h4>
<p>We would like first drafts of chapters by 31 January, 2022. Review &amp; edits would be provided in spring of 2022, with revisions due by early summer 2022.</p>
<h4 id="can-i-use-figurestables"><em>Can I use figures/tables?</em></h4>
<p>Yes! Each figure counts as 500 words, and tables count as 300 words each. As above, though, we are quite flexible on the exact lengths.</p>
<h4 id="who-are-the-other-authors--what-are-their-topics"><em>Who are the other authors &amp; what are their topics?</em></h4>
<p>Once confirmed, we will list the authors and topics below!</p>
<h3 id="should-i-have-an-example-of-the-future"><em>Should I have an &ldquo;example&rdquo; of the future?</em></h3>
<p>This is <em>not necessary!</em> Your chapter can contain any mixture of theoretical arguments, empirical demonstrations, or literature-based conclusions. However, it is useful to stress: your chapter is not a miniature literature review or a proof of concept: it is a 5000-word manifesto!</p>
<h4 id="is-there-any-example-chapter-to-pattern-my-submission-on"><em>Is there any example chapter to pattern my submission on?</em></h4>
<p>No, as we are interested in ensuring that submissions' creativity is both fostered and supported. However, past entries in the <em>Elgar Research Agendas</em> series may be informative for authors seeking this kind of inspiration:</p>

<h3 id="essentially-contested-concepts-in-geography">Essentially Contested Concepts in Geography</h3>
<p>Geographical analysis involves a wide set of academic domains that all share a set of central concepts, concerns, and practices. Chief among these are <em>space</em>, <em>place</em>, <em>scale</em>, and <em>pattern</em>. More recently, <em>reproducibility</em> has re-emerged as a core concern for geographic analysis. This section of <em>A Research Agenda</em> will present how these concepts are conventionally represented and applied. Further, this section will discuss how these concepts may evolve as the discipline itself changes over time.</p>
<h4 id="_space_"><em>Space</em></h4>
<p><em>Sergio Rey (University of California, Riverside)</em></p>
<p>Geographers often use “space” and “geography” interchangeably. However, the concept of <em>space</em> is fairly poorly defined. In quantitative application, <em>space</em> is invariably represented through a set of abstractions, chosen largely for computational or representational convenience. This chapter will discuss the main concept for what <em>space</em> in spatial analysis has generally been. It will also discuss possible futures for how representations of spatial processes could be made more useful or powerful or for how the <em>space</em> in may change.</p>
<h4 id="_place_"><em>Place</em></h4>
<p><em>Tuuli Toivonen (University of Helsinki)</em></p>
<p>For spatial analysis, <em>place</em> is usually the other side of the coin from <em>space</em>. Intimately connected to the concept of “Region” in <em>regional science</em> and critically at issue in many urban applications, <em>place</em> is a critical component of spatial analysis. This chapter will discuss how place has been used in quantitative geography, as well as the new ideas and practices arising in <em>platial</em> study.</p>
<h4 id="_scale_"><em>Scale</em></h4>
<p><em>Stewart Fotheringham (Arizona State University)</em></p>
<p>Outside of spatial analsysis, <em>scale</em> has historically been one of the most significant essentially-contested concepts in geography. The “local” revolution in the 1990s empowered many new ways of estimating <em>scale</em> or ways to use <em>scale</em> to power different kinds of analyses. This chapter will discuss common contemporary notion of <em>scale</em> in different geographical processes and provide a view of how investigations into <em>scale</em> or the use of <em>scale</em> in geographical analyses may change going forward.</p>
<h4 id="_pattern_"><em>Pattern</em></h4>
<p><em>Trisalyn Nelson (University of California, Santa Barbara)</em></p>
<p>Geographers often describe the “structure” of a geographical process as exhibiting <em>pattern</em> when attempting to represent geographical processes in statistical models. But, what each geographer means, exactly, by <em>pattern</em> has historically been contentious, and some patterns are more frequently analyzed, conceptualized, and problematized than others. This chapter will discuss different notions of <em>pattern</em> in geographical analysis, and take a perspective on how <em>pattern</em> might evolve in new areas of geographical study.</p>
<h4 id="_reproducibility_"><em>Reproducibility</em></h4>
<p><em>Chris Brunsdon (Maynooth University)</em></p>
<p><em>Reproducibility</em> is a longstanding concern in geographical analysis. In the last half century, though, the increasing complexity and pervasiveness of computers has changed how geographers think of <em>reproducibility</em>. What, if anything, should be the same from context to context? How can we justify geographical knowledge if results are indeed context-dependent? This chapter will discuss the conceptual issues with reproducibility that have affected the domain in the past, and provide ideas on how the concept of reproducibility may change as geographical analysis evolves.</p>
<h3 id="_agendas-for-domains-of-practice_-coming-soon"><em>Agendas for Domains of Practice</em> <em>(coming soon!)</em></h3>
<p>Geographical analysis, as a domain in itself, involves many different modes of inquiry. Often, these quantitative analyses are distinguished by their methods, but also sometimes by their aims, purposes, and focus of study. In this section of <em>A Research Agenda</em>, authors will discuss the current state-of-the-art of their field. They will also give a perspective on the future of these areas.</p>
