<p><em>Levi John Wolf</em>, <em>Alison Heppenstall</em>, and <em>Rich Harris</em></p>
<p>We invite you to participate in <em>A Research Agenda for Spatial Analysis</em>, a collection of (approximately) by writing a 5000 word perspective on the future of your area by 31 January, 2022.</p>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Back to Berry and Marble&rsquo;s early <em>Spatial Analysis</em> handbook, handbooks in quantitative geography or spatial analysis have provided a venue to take a snapshot of our field as it is. And, while they are produced often, it is both an honor and a rare opportunity to contribute to these <em>Handbooks.</em> More rare than this, however, are opportunities to <em>envision a future for spatial analysis.</em></p>
<p>In this edited volume, <em>A Research Agenda for Spatial Analysis</em>, we invite you to stake a claim on the future of spatial analysis. Think of this as a &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; for the future of your topic. These short chapters (approximately 5000 words, about as long as a <em>Progress in Human Geography</em> &ldquo;Progress Report&rdquo;) are intended to be clear, opinionated, and speculative perspectives on the future of a concept or a domain of practice in spatial analysis.</p>
<p>The edited volume will be split into two halves. In the first part, we invite researchers to reflect on the future of &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo; or &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; that have been central to their research agenda, as well as any <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132519826684">classics that weren&rsquo;t</a>: concepts, books, or papers that have been particularly influential in your thinking but that are not quite as prominent as the ought to be. The second half of <em>RASA</em> will be composed of essays from a variety of scholars who will write about their chosen domain of expertise. In both cases, we are looking for brief but clear-eyed statement of where you think the field is going for your chosen concept or topic.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h4 id="when-is-the-due-date"><em>When is the due date?</em></h4>
<p>We would like first drafts of chapters by 31 January, 2022. Review &amp; edits would be provided in spring of 2022, with revisions due by early summer 2022.</p>
<h4 id="can-i-use-figurestables"><em>Can I use figures/tables?</em></h4>
<p>Yes! Each figure counts as 500 words, and tables count as 300 words each. As above, though, we are quite flexible on the exact lengths.</p>
<h4 id="who-are-the-other-authors--what-are-their-topics"><em>Who are the other authors &amp; what are their topics?</em></h4>
<p>Once confirmed, we will list the authors and topics below!</p>
<h3 id="should-i-have-an-example-of-the-future"><em>Should I have an &ldquo;example&rdquo; of the future?</em></h3>
<p>This is <em>not necessary!</em> Your chapter can contain any mixture of theoretical arguments, empirical demonstrations, or literature-based conclusions. However, it is useful to stress: your chapter is not a miniature literature review or a proof of concept: it is a 5000-word manifesto!</p>
<h4 id="is-there-any-example-chapter-to-pattern-my-submission-on"><em>Is there any example chapter to pattern my submission on?</em></h4>
<p>No, as we are interested in ensuring that submissions' creativity is both fostered and supported. However, past entries in the <em>Elgar Research Agendas</em> series may be informative for authors seeking this kind of inspiration:</p>
