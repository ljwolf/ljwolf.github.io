    <h1 class="title"> Data Competitions </h1>
    <div class="content"> 

<p>I just finished attending the <a href="https://leicester.gisruk.org">2018 GIS Research UK conference</a> at Leicester University.</p>

<p>I presented twice; once on some new methods in <a href="https://ljwolf.org/post/2018-gisruk">spatial clustering</a> and once for the <a href="http://ljwolf.org/post/cdrc-brexit/">CDRC brexit data analysis competition</a>. I had a really good time participating in the data analysis competition, and it struck a chord with me reflecting on quite a few conversations I&rsquo;ve had with my friend &amp; colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/tayloroshan">Taylor</a>.</p>

<p>As graduate students, we were both enamored by the debates in the 1980s &amp; early 90&rsquo;s over spatial structure in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Griffith3/publication/23536862_Explorations_into_the_Relationship_Between_Spatial_Structure_and_Spatial_Interaction/links/568562e708ae051f9af1deec/Explorations-into-the-Relationship-Between-Spatial-Structure-and-Spatial-Interaction.pdf">spatial interaction models</a> and the impact of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0004-5608.00211">geography on ecological inference methods</a>.
These were quite robust exchanges in the literature on specifics of what methods meant, how they were used, and whether they <em>actually</em> solved problems or answered questions they purported to.
Ditto the debate about <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4791617_The_Relevance_of_Hendry's_Econometric_Methodology_Experimental_Simulation_Results_for_Linear_Spatial_Models">general-to-specific model specifications</a> in econometrics in the early 2000s.
I fully admit maybe both Taylor and I are exaggerating the interest and importance of the past&rsquo;s (apparently more) rigorous debate over core constructs in geography.</p>

<h1 id="but-i-don-t-think-we-are-exaggerating">But, I don&rsquo;t think we are exaggerating.</h1>

<p>Take, for instance, the recent (nearly 20-year) scholarly debate about potential problems with multicollinearity in Geographically-Weighted techniques. After initial <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10109-005-0155-6.pdf">results</a> spawn a plethora of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-016-0239-5">debunkings</a>, and just as many re-bunkings, I feel the literature is largely still talking past one another, hence why I tried to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gean.12147">pivot the conversation recently</a> to focus more on the implications of the formal differences in estimators, not chasing the sometimes-realized-but-not-always-generalizable results from simulation experiments.</p>

<p>While there&rsquo;s a significant amount of controversy and debate, and I tend to think that a different perspective on that lit is needed, <em>there is debate.</em> There is a large set of papers disagreeing with one another, providing scrutiny of methods, replications of quantitative geographic research, and sharing code/methods/data to ensure that <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yeRuh80ouxB8qr73M5zg2vBmviQij9YVWEccYOIsM1k/edit?usp=sharing">their horse is the fastest horse in the race.</a>
This is <em>more than</em> reproducible science; this is <strong>contestible</strong> science.</p>

<h1 id="how-much-of-current-quantitative-geography-is-contestible">How much of current quantitative geography is contestible?</h1>

<p><a href="https://geography.osu.edu/people/okelly.1">Morton O&rsquo;Kelley</a> brought up a brilliant question in this vein at the American Association of Geographers meeting. He asked (paraphrasing):
&gt; Maybe the fact that we don&rsquo;t have many retractions/post-submission revisions in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15384632">Geographical Analysis</a> means no one is paying attention? What would it look like if people were contesting these results? How much of what we do is replicable enough to even contest?</p>

<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t know.
But, I know that the few times I&rsquo;ve tried to replicate the frontier of quantitative geographic research, it&rsquo;s exceptionally difficult.
In fact, I&rsquo;ve been cautioned by others in the field before to just avoid replication altogether, since that&rsquo;ll take so much more time and effort than publishing novel results.
Thus, we end up publishing past each other; having parallel conversations on nearly identical topics.
Geographic research isn&rsquo;t replicable because there&rsquo;s no gain to replicate it.
Many conversations occur past each other, and distinct conceptual and statistical challenges like those faced by the local models literature are often not so clearly defined, facilitated, or straightforward to address.</p>

<h1 id="data-competitions-as-preregistration-lite">Data Competitions as Preregistration-Lite</h1>

<p>This is where I see the competition model of science may be super beneficial for our field.
Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program">Hilbert&rsquo;s Program</a> or the <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems">Millenium problems</a>, focusing attention onto specific problems in a field and incentivizing their solution through reputation or modest financial gains is a great way to help tie together academic conversations.
The benefits of these kinds of competitions/challenge programs is that they <em>force</em> us to consider similar/identical problems, speak on common datasets, and actually <strong>use each others&rsquo; research!</strong>.
It was so stimulating to attend the GISRUK CDRC data challenge and see three other groups of people use totally different methods to solve a similar problem as what I did; their perspectives both helped me deepen my own understanding of <em>why I did what I did</em>, but also helped me understand how I might do something differently in the future.
Ideally, this might be done in peer review, but this post-hoc verification strategy seems to be awfully overloaded.</p>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;s reaching common consideration in <a href="https://blog.oup.com/2014/09/pro-con-research-preregistration/">Political Science is the concept of preregistration.</a> While I don&rsquo;t know if preregistration is sufficient (nor applicable) to tie together our too-diffuse conversation in quantitative geography, I think that these kinds of challenges focus attention and energy in a way similar to preregistration for special issues.</p>

<p>Announcing intent to do an analysis, having that intent be selected by your peers to pursue, then conducting the analysis and delivering the exact results you promised to allows the facilitators of the competitions to act as mediators for the conversation, just like special issues for journals.
But, data challenges are drawn together a bit more tightly than special issues, and usually provide more tangible rewards for common integration of work.
Plus, as those past literature debates show, some amount of friction is necessary to hone your points.
In light of this, I&rsquo;ll be pulling however I can to arrange these kinds of announced challenges, competitions, or collaborative topic-driven research events.</p>

<h1 id="it-s-not-really-about-who-wins-it-s-about-how-the-conversation-is-drawn-together">It&rsquo;s not really about who wins; it&rsquo;s about how the conversation is drawn together.</h1>
