            <p>To help subpackages that depend on <code>libpysal</code>, the API will change shortly to be in line with our desired <code>migrating.pysal.org</code> API.</p>
<p>If you test your package against the pypi version of libpysal (which you get using <code>pip install libpysal</code>), you already know that your changes don&rsquo;t break with respect to what exists.
However, if you&rsquo;d like to give yourself some lead time to detect if there are breaking changes in the development version of <code>libpysal</code> on github, feel free to follow these directions on how to set up <em>optional</em> tests on travis. These tests are run alongside the rest of your tests, but they&rsquo;re allowed to fail without marking your build as <em>failing</em> in total.
I call these tests <em>lookahead</em> tests, since they&rsquo;re &ldquo;peeking&rdquo; at the next release of the dependency.</p>
<p>The clearest example of these is in <a href="https://github.com/ljwolf/spreg/blob/master/.travis.yml">spreg</a></p>
<h3 id="the-env-environment">the <code>env</code> environment</h3>
<p>In your <code>.travis.yml</code> file, which governs the tests that are run on travis-ci.org, the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-public-variables-in-.travis.yml"><code>env</code></a> section is used to define <em>enironment variables</em>, which you can think of like options that describe how travis-ci has configured your build. In the case of <a href="https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/.travis.yml#L11">libpysal</a>, we have traditionally defined two sets of tests: one against our bare-bones dependencies (only scipy,numpy, and now pandas), and one against our &ldquo;plus&rdquo; environment, which includes geopandas, shapely, numba, matplotlib, and a few others. We do this to make sure our plus-enabled code (such as the numba map classifiers in <code>mapclassify</code>) always have a usable fallback if the user does not have the required optional dependency.</p>
<p>In this case, we can use the same strategy to implement a testing <em>matrix</em>, which defines all of the combinations of environment variables we might want to use in our test. If you&rsquo;d like to make sure that you&rsquo;re testing against the github versions (but are ok with these failing), then you can slightly modify your <code>.travis.yml</code> file.</p>
<h4 id="defining-the-testing-matrix">defining the testing matrix</h4>
<p>Travis testing matrices are somewhat verbose by default. While small and simple combinations of environments are built by default, it&rsquo;s simpler to state explicitly the combinations in environments you want. So, below, I&rsquo;ll show you how to set up an environment for the case of one additional environment variable <code>PYSAL_PLUS</code>, and one versioning variable: <code>PYSAL_PYPI</code>:</p>
<p>In the <code>env:</code> block, we define all of the distinct combinations of environment variables we want to run:</p>
<pre><code>env: 
    - PYSAL_PYPI=true PYSAL_PLUS=true
    - PYSAL_PYPI=true PYSAL_PLUS=false
    - PYSAL_PYPI=false PYSAL_PLUS=true
    - PYSAL_PYPI=false PYSAL_PLUS=false
</code></pre><p>then, in the <code>matrix:</code> block, we explicitly flag the exact configurations we want to allow to fail. These match against <em>all</em> of the previous configuration options above, including python versions:</p>
<pre><code>matrix:
  allow_failures:
      - python: 3.5
        env: PYSAL_PYPI=false PYSAL_PLUS=false
      - python: 3.5
        env: PYSAL_PYPI=false PYSAL_PLUS=true
      - python: 3.6
        env: PYSAL_PYPI=false PYSAL_PLUS=false
      - python: 3.6
        env: PYSAL_PYPI=false PYSAL_PLUS=true
</code></pre><p>With these two sections, we have defined eight unique tests; two versions of Python (3.5 and 3.6), and the combinations of <code>PYSAL_PLUS</code> and <code>PYSAL_PYPI</code>. Note also a few pitfalls:</p>
<ol>
<li>make sure there is no space between the equals sign and the value you&rsquo;re setting the env to</li>
<li>make sure that your repeat <code>env</code> every time you have an entry in <code>allow_failures</code>, so travis can attempt to match your previously-defined setup patterns.</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t forget to include the python versions you&rsquo;re testing in the first line of the <code>allow_failures</code> entries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great; we&rsquo;ve defined a testing matrix where we can check 8 combinations of tests. However, by default, these will only queue builds with these configurations; if nothing in our build script takes these variables into account, we won&rsquo;t do anything different when we run our tests. So, to make this useful, we <em>then</em> have to use these environment variables in our <code>.travis.yml</code>&rsquo;s <code>before_install</code> or <code>install</code> sections. I&rsquo;m building this example for subpackages (and have worked this out for <a href="https://github.com/ljwolf/spreg/blob/master/.travis.yml#L9"><code>spreg</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ljwolf/esda/blob/master/.travis.yml#L10"><code>esda</code></a>), so this&rsquo;ll be focused on allowing <code>libpysal</code> to get installed from <code>pypi</code> versus from <code>github</code>.</p>
<p>To change your <code>before_install</code> section depending on these environment variable settings, we need to use <a href="https://github.com/ljwolf/esda/blob/master/.travis.yml#L39">bash conditionals</a>. These are just like Python conditionals (<code>if/else</code> statements), but they&rsquo;re a bit less easy to make <em>just work</em>. So, I&rsquo;d recommend you follow this pattern <em>exactly</em> in your <code>.travis.yml</code> for a variable named <code>PYSAL_PYPI</code> which has been set to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code>- if &quot;$PYSAL_PYPI&quot;; then
    echo &quot;do option PYSAL_PYPI&quot;; do second command;
    else echo &quot;do not do option PYSAL_PYPI&quot;; do more commands; 
  fi;
</code></pre><p>Formatting in bash can be fairly tricky, so try to stick closely to how this is formatted. Notably, the conditional <code>if &quot;$PYSAL_PYPI&quot;</code> should only be used if setting variables to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Finally, make sure that you always return to your original location if you intend to use <code>cd</code>; there is no automatic tracking of the base directory like in a <code>make</code> command.</p>
<p>So, for instance, consider the following snippit from the proposed <code>esda</code> build configuration. This uses the same build structure above, testing all python versions in a &ldquo;rich&rdquo; environment with <code>numba</code> and a &ldquo;bare&rdquo; environment without <code>numba</code>, and either grabs <code>libpysal</code> from PyPI or grabs its current <code>master</code> branch on github:</p>
<pre><code>  - if &quot;$PYSAL_PYPI&quot;; then
        echo 'testing pypi libpysal' &amp;&amp; pip install libpysal;
        else echo 'testing git libpysal'; git clone https://github.com/pysal/libpysal.git; cd libpysal; pip install .; cd ../;
    fi;
  - conda install --yes --file requirements.txt;
  - if &quot;$PYSAL_PLUS&quot;; then conda install --yes numba; fi
</code></pre><p>The first conditional, when <code>$PYSAL_PYPI</code> is <code>true</code>, will use <code>pip install libpysal</code> to install <code>libpysal</code> from PyPI. When it is <code>false</code>, however, the line starting with <code>else</code> will execute. There, I&rsquo;ve chained a few commands together. I always use that <code>echo</code> command to ensure that I can go back through the travis logs and make sure which branch of the conditional has executed. Then, after the <code>echo</code>, I run many commands all on the same line. There is no line length limit, and using line continuation characters can get misread by the way travis parses the <code>.travis.yml</code>. This is just me being risk-averse, though, so if you figure out a nicer way to do this, feel free to do so. In this section following the <code>else</code>, I clone <code>libpysal</code> from github, <code>cd</code> into my new clone, install this cloned version using <code>pip</code>, and then change back to my original directory. Together, this gives me the version of <code>libpysal</code> that exists directly in the github <code>master</code> branch.
The second conditional checks if <code>$PYSAL_PLUS</code> is set to <code>true</code>. If it is, we also want to enrich our testing environment with <code>numba</code>, so we can check the <code>numba</code>-accelerated computations.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-this-at-all">why do this at all?</h3>
<p>For a few reasons, but mainly as a hedge against change:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep your submodule up-to-date with possible breaking changes in your dependencies, especially those dependencies you use frequently.</li>
<li>Ensure your library wont break if another maintainer releases a new version that behaves slightly differently from what you expect or what you recall.</li>
<li>Check if your fixes to an unpublished but under-development API change in a dependency work.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-beauty-of-social-solutions">The beauty of social solutions</h3>
<p>Overall, though, tests (and ci, and github itself) is nothing without social norms driving this process.
Using this lookahead testing, you can even decide to merge PRs that <em>fail</em> the pypi-facing tests but pass the <em>lookahead</em>, since the<em>lookahead</em> is the future version of the package your package will need to accommodate.<br>
And, finally, this is only intended to give you peace of mind; if you feel this is too complicated to implement or maintain, just run your tests manually and don&rsquo;t get too surprised if breakage occurs.</p>
