<p>Today marks the first day of a new year (in a way). No, it&rsquo;s not the first day of another year at Bristol: it&rsquo;s the first day of a new lab notebook. I&rsquo;ve been keeping lab notebooks consistently since the start of my PhD, but I&rsquo;ve only kept the ones since I moved to Bristol in 2017. I think the practice is very helpful; something about writing things down (not typing) helps me hold onto them more. And, so much of what is digital feels ephemeral, even if it&rsquo;s recorded forever. This latest notebook spans from early 2019 through an incredibly busy (although somewhat productive) AY2019-2020 and throughout lockdown til now.</p>
<p>I guess the main thing I&rsquo;ve realized is that it&rsquo;s OK to be cyclical. Reading through the journal, there are flurries of activity and engagement, with attendent notes &amp; comments in the book, and then troughs where nothing really reads right, and I&rsquo;ve got no notes in the book. Especially this year, where my duties as &ldquo;Weekend Family Quiz Answer Recorder&rdquo; led me to commandeer many pages with trivia answers and scribbles between a spring spent kneading sourdough and chasing goats out of the field. I used to get frustrated with this cycle, thinking that it was either unusual or, at the very least, unhelpful. If I could only maintain the sprint, I&rsquo;d be so much more productive!</p>
<p>But now, I think it&rsquo;s starting to feel a bit natural&hellip; especially now that I&rsquo;m getting a better sense of what is normal for people to expect of one another (both others of me and me of myself).</p>
