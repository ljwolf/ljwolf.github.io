            <p>I&rsquo;ve been getting very interested in the concept of the &ldquo;boomerang generation&rdquo; and the tension that broader social trend has with ideas around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/style/cottagecore.html">Cottagecore</a>. They&rsquo;re two very strong forces acting on the middle class&hellip; returning to intergenerational houses, folks can afford to live in the city. But, if the young increasingly <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to live in cities due to changing tastes and preferences, then we get another wave of suburbanization. Given my own short stint &ldquo;boomeranging&rdquo; to the countryside during the COVID-19 lockdown,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;ve been very intrigued by the intersection of the &ldquo;return of the multi-generational&rdquo; household and (possible) change in the tastes and preferences of young, house-buying people.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>As far as a determinant on social and economic mobility, it&rsquo;s a big deal. Financially, it really helps, but practically, I think it might deprive young adults of opportunities and experiences that are otherwise critical to building soft skills and networks. I&rsquo;m throwing myself into this socio-demographic literature to complement some other work I have going on , but it&rsquo;s still fascinating nonetheless.</p>
<p>Since the ONS provides a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/datasets/youngadultslivingwiththeirparents">solid dataset</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, I decided to try my hand at a few simple visualizations. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET">neet</a> stuff!</p>
<p>For the overall boomeranging of young adults, 15-34, we see a slight increase. Especially in the &ldquo;second hump&rdquo; centered around the early-to-mid twenties:</p>
<p><img src="/images/boomerang.gif" alt="overall boomeranging"></p>
<p>That rise from approx. 35% to approx. 40% comes mainly from folks between 20 and 27 returning home. Focusing in, we can see a more pronounced shift in homeward bound populations of young people.</p>
