<p>I suppose that it&rsquo;s good that I&rsquo;m happy where I am at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that things like having a pet (or a kid!) might change you in unexpected ways, but can it/does it parallel the severity/magnitude of changes you experience in your first thirty? And, given that (at least in the UK) it&rsquo;s quite difficult to make the transition from &ldquo;renting young professional&rdquo; to &ldquo;family-stable homeowner&rdquo; due to the intricate and restrictive powers that landlords have over your habitation in the UK, turning 30 definitely feels a bit stultifying.</p>
<p>Who knows. I suppose this is just one of a few thoughts you get to think at the &ldquo;big&rdquo; birthdays.</p>
