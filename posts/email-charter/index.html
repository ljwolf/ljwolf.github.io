<p>I <em>really</em> like the University of Bristol&rsquo;s new <a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/hr/documents/wellbeing/email-charter.pdf">email charter</a>. But, I think it could be made a little more clear and actionable, especially since it can build off of previous work and thought about making emails clearer, shorter, and fewer in number. Below, I&rsquo;ll go through the points listed in the original charter and try to make them clearer. I&rsquo;ll also try to add some <em>actions</em> that add some teeth to the points. My comments are in italics.</p>
<h2 id="respect-recipients-time">Respect Recipients&rsquo; Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the message sender, the onus is on you to minimize the time your email will take to process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A few practices I&rsquo;ve seen that help this include:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://five.sentenc.es/"><em>Never send an email longer than 5 sentences</em></a>.</li>
<li><em>Use formatting to your advantage. Keep it simple, but use italics, bold font, and enumeration/itemized lists to help readers scan the email for the asks, dates, or times you want to foreground.</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-is-not-rude">Short is not Rude</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you receive a brief reply, don&rsquo;t take it personally. Wordy responses take longer to compose and to read.</li>
<li>If you need a richer exchange of ideas or concepts, call the recipient or arrange a meeting.</li>
<li>If you need an immediate reply, just call the person. If you&rsquo;ve been sent an email, know that <em>if it were urgent, you would get a call.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="celebrate-clarity">Celebrate clarity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start with a subject line that labels the topic. *(Indeed, consider using the subject line to make the ask itself in about 50 characters.)</li>
<li>*<em>Identify whether the email is a request for information or action and indicate its priority</em>.</li>
<li>If an email has to be long, make sure the first five sentences work like an <em>abstract, providing the reason for writing and the main request.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quash-open-ended-questions">Quash Open-ended Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simplify your questions. Make them easy to answer. It is asking a lot to send someone an email with several long paragraphs of text followed by a non-specific question, such as &ldquo;thoughts?&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Rhetorical questions and sarcasm are unclear over email. They are rarely appropriate</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="slash-surplus-ccs">Slash Surplus CC&rsquo;s</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider who needs to be copied into the email. For every recipient you add, you increas the total response time.</li>
<li>When there are multiple recipients to an email, do not default to &ldquo;Reply All.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Do not CC individuals who &ldquo;may be interested,&rdquo; but have not asked to be CC&rsquo;d. Send pertinent informtion directly to the intended recipient(s).</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tighten-the-thread">Tighten the Thread</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some emails depend on surrounding messages in the thread for context. <em>If changing the context of the conversation, such as when adding recipients or referring a conversation to someone else, use the header to clearly re-contextualize the past information.</em></li>
<li>Where possible, try not to extend a thread beyond 3 emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attack-attachments">Attack Attachments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not use graphics or files that appear as attachments.</li>
<li>Do not send text as an attachment if it could have been included in the body of the email.</li>
<li><em>Do not send multiple different emails with attachments that belong in the same thread. If necessary, resend all attachments when updates are made to any copy.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="give-a-gift">Give a Gift</h2>
<ul>
<li>If your email message can be expressed in less than 10 words, put it in the subject line and leave a short statement in the subject.</li>
<li>Ending an email with &ldquo;no need to respond&rdquo; if you do not need a response to a question or action. <em>However, consider whether sending an email at all is the appropriate way to state what would need to be stated in this fashion. It is patronizing to send a long email informing others of <strong>your</strong> thoughts, but suggesting others&rsquo; thoughts are not needed</em>.</li>
<li><em>Take an action or make a distinct proposal, and suggest that it be approved unless folks reply to object.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cut-contentless-responses">Cut Contentless Responses</h2>
<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to reply to every email, especially those that are themselves clear responses. An email saying &ldquo;Thanks for your note. I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo; does not need an additional reply confirming reciept.</li>
<li>*<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackballing">Dissent-based decisionmaking</a>, where the motion is carried unless a certain threshold of individuals dissent, helps reduce empty &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; responses required by majoritarian balloting</li>
</ul>
