    <div class="content"> <p>I&rsquo;m not so interested about the comparatives with Apple, but down in the <code>Data Alchemy</code> Section, O'Beirne talks about how these pink zones might just correspond to peoples&rsquo; conceptual notions of where commerce corridors (I&rsquo;ve now learned are called &ldquo;high streets&rdquo; over here in the UK) are.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet urban accessibility and desirability is often a function of these &ldquo;ritz&rdquo; zones. I know that, when I lived in San Francisco (before these were rolled out), the commercial zone along Cortland down in Bernal Heights was a spot my girlfriend and I frequented.</p>

<p>Jumping forward to when I moved to Brooklyn, I found these pink zones invaluable in judging where I might want to live close to, without ever really targeting any specific amenities within them.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m curious for a whole lotta reasons. Do they correspond to streetscores? Do they correspond to price-clusters in Airbnb data? Are they really accessible (both temporally and monetarily) to the people who live around them? Is there a way to distinguish them from commute-zones, like the pink clusters around every major intersection in Tempe, AZ?</p>

<p><p>This kind of algorithmic designation of commerce zones is super interesting to me, and I&rsquo;d love to keep integrating it into my scholarship.</p>
