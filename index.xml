      <description>rather than taking what I like about places I find in Bristol at face value.
I guess sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to relinquish that inherent comparative streak.
Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;m still seeking that best pub that does good coffee and serves beer by 1.

      <title>&lt;p&gt;This is a quick exploration/exposition of the fact that estimated substantive effects (fixed effects in H&amp;amp;R&amp;rsquo;s terms) can and sometimes will change in models with spatially dependent error terms when (and only when) the dependence in the error term is collinear with one or more covariates in the design matrix.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

      <description>Intuitively, this makes sense. In a thought experiment, estimate a regression. Then, introduce a covariate that&amp;rsquo;s collinear with the other covariates. If there&amp;rsquo;s no structure used in the model to keep track of which are the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; effects and which are the newcomers (e.g. a partial regression structure), then the effect estimates must change, since each is conditional on the other/they&amp;rsquo;re made jointly over the covariates.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not so interested about the comparatives with Apple, but down in the Data Alchemy Section, O&#39;Beirne talks about how these pink zones might just correspond to peoples&amp;rsquo; conceptual notions of where commerce corridors (I&amp;rsquo;ve now learned are called &amp;ldquo;high streets&amp;rdquo; over here in the UK) are.
I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet urban accessibility and desirability is often a function of these &amp;ldquo;ritz&amp;rdquo; zones. I know that, when I lived in San Francisco (before these were rolled out), the commercial zone along Cortland down in Bernal Heights was a spot my girlfriend and I frequented.</description>

If you don’t (or aren’t too comfortable with math), I still aim to keep the main text accessible. So, skip the equations &amp;amp; distributions if they’re too much :)

      <description>For a while, I was really interested in writing this article, “strange as it ever was,” looking at whether geometric measures of district compactness are really worse nowadays than they were before the use of computer redistricting. And, while I can’t say that the development of computers did this, I’d be willing to bet that the aggregated decline is more related to the introduction of strict population constraints. Tags: geography, redistricting</description>

      <description>This is a great article on the corporatization of the intellectual, or really the origin of the &amp;ldquo;thought leader&amp;rdquo; by David Sessions. An illumination of Dan Drezner&amp;rsquo;s new book, the Ideas Industry, reviewer David Sessions outlines Drezner&amp;rsquo;s main arguments and connects them back to a Gramscian perspective on the social responsibility of the intellectual.
In doing so, Sessions sees Drezner extending and furthering Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s concerns about the lunchpail academic &amp;amp; professionalization of academic work into the construction of an entirely new &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; intellectual.</description>

      <description>Cory was able to stop using multiple monitors thanks to virtual desktops, a staple of just about every Linux desktop environment. If I could focus on more than one thing at a time, I’d use them, too!
 I definitely transitioned to using a single, 27 inch 4k monitor. When plugged in from my laptop, I don&amp;rsquo;t use the laptop screen (or I just keep like&amp;hellip; a pomodoro timer up on it.</description>

      <description>I almost forgot to mention this here: I’ve put up code on how to use some common spatial econometric models in Stan and PyMC3. For PyMC3, the implementations provide two methods that make the evaluation of thelikelihood very fast when compared to PyMC3′s native logdet function. These two methods are implemented as custom theano ops that are cache some information to improve the speed of the gradient evaluation. One uses sparse LU factorization to provides the log determinant very quickly without precomputation.</description>

      <title>&lt;p&gt;Hello all! In working on my my dissertation on gerrymandering, I’ve put together a new dataset on Congressional districting. In it, I’ve joined up the database of congressional district shapes from Jeff Lewis at UCLA with some data from the ICPSR and the Constituency-Level Electoral Archive. I’ve made the data available on the Open Science Framework (linked) and submitted to &lt;i&gt;Scientific Data&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you use the data!&lt;/p&gt;</title>

      <description>After writing briefly about burnout in July, when I had done a Google Summer of Code while working as a Research Assistant on a grant about spatial multilevel modeling, I was super burnt out. Now, I’d like to safely say, while I’m still stressed and spread too thin over too many projects, I don’t feel burnt out any longer. The main thing I realized is the importance of switching into “write-only” mode.</description>

      <description>I’m pretty skeptical of the generalized uniform partisan swing assumption in gerrymandering models. Part of this is due to some skepticism about how swing actually occurs in elections generally. If we don’t have an explicit “shock” model for our counterfactuals, they’re probably not going to replicate true experienced electoral swings well. 
I’ve put together a notebook where I go through and explore some modeling of the 2012-2016 electoral swing at the county level.</description>

      <description>I am so done with programming for python 2.
This is the convergence in a spatial parameter in a spatial model I’m working with. This is a very long run that took a few hours to complete. Tests of this on my (python 3) compute server went fine, tuned correctly, but didn’t have this dramatic convergence.
Once the sampling finished, I looked at the acceptance rate and, sure enough, the AR on the metropolis step of this Gibbs sampler was like&amp;hellip; .</description>

      <description>After reading Wasserman’s 2012 blog post about mixture models, I’m glad that I’ve finally figured out &amp;amp; implemented the Gelman-King 1994 electoral model as well. Based on pretty straghtforward regression modeling, the setup trades the representational simplicity of the Linzer GMM model for a much more complex modeling structure, but that I guess provides better guarantees about its own properties. Regardless, it’s a bummer that these guys stuff, theLinzer 2012 paper on simulating seats/votes curves using gaussian mixtures &amp;amp; the JudgeIt stuff for the GK1994 paper was never merged into the political science computational library.</description>

      <description>Sorry, couldn’t resist the opportunity to buzzfeed this research blog :)
I’ve been trying to get really efficient at writing samplers for various Bayesian spatial models. And, typically, this involves clever numerical tricks, trying to avoid computing either log determinants or matrix inverses by keeping around matrix factorizations or finding derived products that you can persist between iterations. Some of this has come to fruition in my sparse log determinant work, but I’m always looking for computation speed gains, especially as some of the targets I&amp;rsquo;ve optimized are drying up.</description>

      <description>So, maybe this is part of the learning experience of developing applied intuition, but I never really appreciated how important it is to center your variables, especially when dealing with finicky models like simultaneous autoregressive models common in spatial econometrics.
The following are three traces from a spatial econometric model, the spatial lag model, on some example data. 
The first one hasn’t centered its variables. The lag coefficient is trying very hard to escape the (-1,1) bounding on stable autoregressive coefficients.</description>

I am spending a lot of my graduate school experience being told those edges should be sharper. That my writing or my thinking has too many “could,” “may,” and “likely.” That I sell myself, my product, or my ideas short via qualifications and pervasive focus on the challenges my work faces or might face rather than the successes I may have at hand and or have had before.</description>

Since most of the work I’ve been doing involves using soft dependencies with the library, it’s important to get this right. The gist is here.

      <description>Python’s got some pretty cool ways to enable unorthodox behavior. For my project, I’ve found myself writing a lot of closures around our existing class init functions, and have decided it might be easier &amp;amp; more consistent to express this as what it really is: partial application. Partial application is pretty simple to enable for python class constructors, since the separate new method allows you to construct closures around initialization routines.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to take a break from the spatial hierarchical linear modeling kick I&amp;rsquo;ve been on recently to get back to some GSOC work.
Today, I had my weekly call with my mentors.
On today&amp;rsquo;s call, my mentors and I discussed a few things.
Testing &amp;amp; Merging of project code Since many of the improvements I&amp;rsquo;m making to the library are module-by-module, I was advised to submit PRs when a logical unit of contribution is ready to ship.</description>

      <description>NOTE: A demo of the relevant code I&amp;rsquo;m referring to for the new labelled array API in pysal.weights in this update is available in this notebook, and the actual code lives in a weights2 module in my gsoc feature branch.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to target our weights module to prototype the labelled array interface. In general, we&amp;rsquo;ll need extensions built into at least our exploratory spatial data analysis module, esda, our spatial regression module, spreg, and our spatial dynamics module, spatial_dynamics.</description>

      <description>The followng were comments I recieved on my Request for Comment submitted a bit ago.
Questions about Request for Comment:
What should I prioritize? NOGR or Labeled Array Interface? Labeled Array. This is critical to get correct, and will make NOGR need and scope clearer. How deep into PySAL should the Labeled Array interface go? Design it like the library were getting built now. Do not fail on import. Instead, use soft dependencies/optional import patterns if necessary, write Python3-only components safely, so that new features can be leveraged.</description>

      <description>Hey all!
While I may have put the cart before the horse in doing an RFC before an introduction, it’s never too late :)
My name is Levi John Wolf. I am a PhD candidate at Arizona State University. I study spatial statistics, econometrics, &amp;amp; polimetrics, focusing on campaigns, elections, &amp;amp; inequality. I am a Google Summer of Code student for the Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL), under the Python Software Foundation (PSF).</description>

      <description>Clarifying a Core Data Model for PySAL  Gist here From my perspective, I see my proposal for GSOC as containing two oblique foci. My hope in drafting this notebook for my fellow authors is to make this clear.
I think at this point, many people who use &amp;amp; develop PySAL would like to see better tooling for Pandas$\leftrightarrow$PySAL interaction. This was started by Luc, Dani, &amp;amp; myself in the pysal.</description>

      <description>So, a while back, I was using a new compactness metric to extend some gerrymandering studies. In attempting the replication, I found some minor math errors in the original paper that made it diffcult to get valid values for the statistic.
After trying multiple times to verify whether it was my code or if the published statistic had some typographical error, I went to the original author, shared my concerns, and found that it did.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a lot to fellow developers about making PySAL objects more than containers for the results of a statistical procedure.
One way I think we can do this is to focus on methods like predict, find, update, or reclassify.
So, here, I&amp;rsquo;ll show the way I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a simple API to update map classifiers by defining their __call__ method.

      <description>Owen, Harris, &amp;amp; Jones have a pretty cool new paper out discussing strengths &amp;amp; weaknesses of hierarchical/multilevel linear modelling. In a wonderfully readable review paper, they pretty simply state in the review that hierarchical models don&amp;rsquo;t directly answer the classic question at the heart of tons of geographic research:
 Given that you live where you do, talk to who you do, and interact with the social milleau that you do, how is your behavior different?</description>

      <description>I just wrote up a notebook for a fellow PhD student on how I use python&amp;rsquo;s builtin multiprocessing library to do embarassingly parallel computations much faster. Every time I think about it, I&amp;rsquo;m floored at how simple using the builtin multiprocessing library is for certain operations.
There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of uncertainty out there around the state of parallel computing in Python, and I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert. But, I figure if it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for the unicorn I worked for, it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for a computational social scientist.</description>

      <description>tl;dr: ask yourself these before you deadlift optimize code
I use Python pretty much daily, but I’m definitely not a Python wizard. Now that I’m done with converting the Python Spatial Analytics Library to use Python 3 compatible idioms, I took a break from refactoring more generally.
But, in doing two small tests/stabs at refactoring for speed &amp;amp; memory usage, I’m reminded why optimizing numerical code is so hard. I’ve heard &amp;ldquo;there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch,” so I’m usually wary about getting into performance optimization stuff, but these two recent instances really drive this point home for me again.</description>

      <description>My dissertation is on gerrymandering. While I’m very sure it’s not the best way to do it, many people use geometric measures of district shapes as a way to detect gerrymandering. 
One of the oldest and most well-used is the Reock measure, first developed in 1960. It’s a bit tougher than other kinds of gerrymandering measures to construct. For instance, the most popular measure is the Polsby-Popper measure, as used in this Washinton Post piece, is actually identical to a shape measure calle the Isoperimetric Quotient.</description>

      <description>I started my PhD running away from Political Science/Political Geography as fast as I could, into Industrial Engineering and Computer Science-y topics. I’m still what many would call a “methodologist,” am wholly entertained by computational geometry &amp;amp; statistics, and enjoy math and programming a little too much to be fully motivated by applied work. But, gradually, I’ve started filtering back, situated with some top-flight quantitative geographers at the GeoDa Center for Spatial Analysis and Geocomputation, into work by Micah Altman, Andrew Gelman, Gary King, Jowei Chen, and Jonathan Rodden&amp;hellip; tons of political scientists.</description>

      <description>After programming Haskell, R, or Python for about 6 years now, I feel like I’m sufficiently skilled with Python to make anything that I want to do in python immediate.
I understand its execution model. I feel very confident in my understandings of how python objects work. The fastest/lightest way to get what I want seems like it’s relatively easy to achieve.
In a sense, I feel competent. And that makes me feel a little complacent, and a little stagnant.</description>

      <description>If you haven’t read/paid attention to the Numpy Governance Discussions goingon in the numpy discussion mailing list, I wouldn’t blame you. They’re probably dry and boring.
But, for me, as someone who has been involved in a few Free/Open source communities over the past 8 years, I’m sensing a very interesting divide in the Numpy discussion (and FOSS Python more broadly) that I think is presented more strongly there than I’ve seen it elsewhere.</description>

      <description>I feel like there are two big, “pivotal” realizations in my story so far of learning to program. While I’m sure not everyone moves from Haskell to Shen to R to Python before really feeling competent in a language, I have seen many peers grapple with them. 
1. Separate your code and data. I think this would be more aptly stated as Think Abstractly, but that belies the immediacy that the first statement provides.</description>

      <description>First time using CartoDB. Pretty cool that you can just embed the map anywhere and it renders in an iframe.  This is a map of the Polsby-Popper metric for US Congressional districts. In essence, people use it to identify how &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; a political district&amp;rsquo;s shape is, with larger values being more &amp;ldquo;regular.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s the same as used in a washington post piece. My methodology differs a bit from their published map, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to figure out how to get the neat little hover info on the WaPo map.</description>

 Yes you should all be using Python 3, and I know that you all want to, but I know it&amp;rsquo;s difficult. You all have large amounts of Python 2 code in production that you&amp;rsquo;ve ported to Python 2.7.9 &amp;hellip; but the step to Python 3 from there is still phenomenal.
You can&amp;rsquo;t just fix a few style nets and remove a few L&amp;rsquo;s from long integers.</description>

      <description>I usually don’t think much about credentialization online. I have a few internet aliases (like yetanothergeographer) that I consider almost totally synonymous with my real name and persona. And even other personas on tumblr or other social networking sites are easily traced back to my “full” identity.
But, something that I found pretty shocking recently was the fact that any github profile you can find shows your public ssh keys to everyone.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been using my tools for census data exploration, as intensely as I&amp;rsquo;d hope you have, you might’ve noticed that the Census limits queries to 50 columns per query.
I’ve got your back, though. The newest release, cenpy 0.7, now supports n-column queries by chunking through 50-coulumns at a time. Be careful, though, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you pull down the entire Census 2010 short form in one go, you will probably get rate limited.</description>

 CenPy - An exploratory interface to the Census API
So, I was looking to do some programmatic access to US Census Bureau data and was finding myself a little frustrated with how limited current tools in Python were to work with the connections. Mainly, most supported only a few protocols, provided no documentation or exploration functionality, and left it primarily up to exeternal documentation to provide information on how to query the API.</description>

      <description>The more that I work with broad datasets, collected from many different means and used in many different contexts, the more I think that you really only need the &amp;ldquo;multi&amp;rdquo; instantiation of polygons, lines, and points. Usually, due to database typecasting, you want to coerce any heterogeneous datatypes into the same datatype. Since it&amp;rsquo;s much simpler to cast Polygons upwards into MultiPolygons, I&amp;rsquo;m rarely seeing any Polygons or Lines, even in datasets where the majority of features are single-component.</description>

      <description>Anyone running Debian testing/unstable, heads up on a breakage in pip that bit me this morning. Now I’m stuck with versions of ipython that dont work, as the apt package is broken and pip is broken.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m loath to install it manually, rather than through a package manager, I&amp;rsquo;m out of luck at the moment until the maintainer fixes the package. :(

So far, everything&amp;rsquo;s been nice. I was worried I&amp;rsquo;d be living in a very yuppie neighborhood, but, at first brush, Bernal Heights seems to have held onto a sense of localness.
Which brings me to the question of how to answer &amp;ldquo;Are you local?&amp;rdquo; I heard this asked to a few people today, eavesdropping across bars and coffeeshops during my first day of urban orienteering.</description>

      <description>I just got done teaching a short workshop on GIS in Python. Something may be odd to those of you who use FOSS packages to do GIS: I didn&amp;rsquo;t use any GeoPandas.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a constraint I wanted. But, just getting pure pip-installable packages like Shapely and PySAL was difficult enough. The admins didn&amp;rsquo;t want to install one of the big scientific Python distributions and would only let something with minimal impact get used.</description>

      <description>The Normalized Mass Moment of Inertia proposed by Li et al (2013) is deceptively hard to express. Given some shape and a distribution of attributes around the shape, they state the NMMI ratio in Fan et al (forthcoming) as:
$$NMMI = \frac{I_O^&amp;rsquo;} {I^{G_i}_{i_mass}}$$
where $I$ represents the area-standardized mass moment of inertia. The $O$ subscript denotes that the numerator is the mass moment of inertia of some null reference shape. I will discuss the denominator later.</description>

      <description>You know, I like all this math and engineering material I&amp;rsquo;m enrolled in, and I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at it. But it&amp;rsquo;s fairly frustrating listening to engineers talk about systems where this material gets applied as if they&amp;rsquo;re fully generic.I&amp;rsquo;m starting to hit that point where the divisions between physical and natural systems are creeping in.
Flashbacks to my decision to study political science and not Industrial Engineering are becoming more and more common.</description>

      <description>Wow, did not expect this to be as big of an issue as it has been.
Pysal removed the code for generating voronoi diagrams for the standard library. Not sure why.
Instead, on the mailing list, the project BDFL provides code for a diagram of randomized points.
Adapting this, I should be good. Though, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask why it was dropped from pysal.core or pysal.cg.

      <description>Elections, Bayes, and one realization about the Gelman-King Model People make a lot of hay out of the rise of Nate Silver and Bayesian poll averaging when it comes to the rise of data-driven electoral prediction and analysis. When it comes to data-driven politics, these methods are pretty neat. But, they&amp;rsquo;re based on very old understandings of statistics which, in the right light, seem quite intuitive. Gelman-King (1994)&amp;rsquo;s model Say, for instance, we&amp;rsquo;re examining some vector of electoral outcomes, (y) given some predictor matrix (\mathbf{X}).</description>

      <description>So, having just completed our welcome weekend for prospective Ph.D. students, I think I might have suggestions for anyone going to one in the future.
1. Try to have fun. It can be a wild, stressful, busy few days. But, above all, you should be trying to figure how much you like the people you&amp;rsquo;re with.
2. Balance breadth and depth. Yes, you may want to work with only a few people, but departments are communities.</description>

It seems like LISP really was a consummately expressive language, and it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating sometimes to not have simple things I got used to when learning the functionals like Scheme and Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;</title>

      <description>That aside, this macro capability is amazing, and it&amp;rsquo;s illustrated here to quite the effect. The stupidly simple knapsack I implemented is done here in three lines that are much more semantically meaningful than my larger program. They macros are extended at run time into full expressions, and their data structure is much better for the solution of general knapsack problems. My implementation would not quite win out in a diff battle.</description>

      <description>Trying to express an area of specialization is surprisingly difficult. But, these exercises in perspective-stretching are important to realize the limits to both your knowledge and the knowledge at the frontier of research. When intently focused on the smallest of details about the implementation of an out-of-kilter algorithm, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget that, while it&amp;rsquo;s hard to figure out how to implement a stochastic constraint solver in Haskell, there are broader problems.</description>

1.) Begin tracking, however informally, a record of effort in many problem areas. In a very real sense, I anticipate this becoming a journal for stray thoughts, recommendations, and discoveries about the minutiae of daily life.
2.) Encounter new or alternative sources of inspiration and perspective on problems and questions.</description>
