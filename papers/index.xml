      <description>This paper culminates a bit of work I&amp;rsquo;ve started on since seeing a talk by Phil Chodrow on a paper that eventually became his quite interesting NAS paper paper on segregation and entropy surfaces.
I was intrigued by the prospect of using spectral clustering for constrained clustering problems. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;d known that affinity matrix clustering could be adapted to constrained contexts ever since reading about hierarchical ward clustering, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen a really convincing method that showed me how I could work this out for a general affinity-matrix clustering method.</description>
