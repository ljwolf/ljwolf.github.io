      <description>You know, I like all this math and engineering material I&amp;rsquo;m enrolled in, and I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at it. But it&amp;rsquo;s fairly frustrating listening to engineers talk about systems where this material gets applied as if they&amp;rsquo;re fully generic.I&amp;rsquo;m starting to hit that point where the divisions between physical and natural systems are creeping in.
Flashbacks to my decision to study political science and not Industrial Engineering are becoming more and more common.</description>
