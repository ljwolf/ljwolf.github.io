      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a good idea for what many places in the UK are like, nor for what the structure of some of this data is when considering its joint structure. So, while my model fits quite well and yields some interesting results, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit limited because I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what a place like Barrow-in-Furness is like, without looking into it.
In general, it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to get a sense of what the model&amp;rsquo;s telling me from the conditional estimates because I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a sense of the joint picture: I don&amp;rsquo;t really intuit how they covary across places, like I might in US counties or states.</description>

      <description>Not sure where this happens, since I&amp;rsquo;m just using sparse matrices here. I guess they might get densified somewhere below me &amp;amp; then that overhead allocation doesn&amp;rsquo;t get returned to other processes, it&amp;rsquo;s just claimed by the jupyter kernel.
Which&amp;hellip;. means that my two kernels compete for space.

      <description>I find that the hardest part for me to be motivated about is the stage right after I finish the proof of concept. It&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;hellip; once the new stuff is done, I get much less interested than when I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to figure it out.
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s probably pretty common among researchers, but the thrill of wrestling with a genuinely new problem is interesting, enjoyable, and difficult. Sometimes, it feels like documenting that wrestling is a bit tedious.</description>

      <description>Instead, why not just use their frontends and plt.ion()? Unix + tiling WM is truly a system-wide IDE, but I never learned the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; tooling for working with matplotlib at the cli.
The first time I learned matplotlib I learned it in a notebook. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m wedded to tiling &amp;amp; strongly prefer the terminal ipython to the notebook, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta learn all the older tooling for matplotlib.</description>

      <description>District shape isn’t at all related to political impact (in aggregate) when it comes to redistricting.
While some weird districts may exist and those may be gerrymandered, the relationship is not statistically sound in aggregate: weird districts might be completely benign, in terms of the partisan advantage measures I’m considereding my dissertation &amp;amp; other classical measures of model influence.
Totally discounting the “expressive harms” arguments in this sphere, though.</description>

      <description>The smallest little errors give you some pretty weird results when you&amp;rsquo;re looking deeply into the data. In this case, Doug Bosco only ran against David Redick. Creighton and Binderup were oppononents of another Democrat that year, the then-congresswoman now-senator Barbara Boxer.
But, the incorrect story in the data is kind of interesting to consider&amp;hellip; two Republicans ran in CA-CD01 in 1984, and won a combined total of &amp;gt;50% of the vote.</description>

      <description>You see, the full likelihood of the model I&amp;rsquo;m working with is something like:
$$|I - \rho W| \times \mathcal{N}(X\beta + \rho W y, \sigma^2) $$
And, since (W) and (I) are constants, I actually need the gradient of the log determinant with respect to ( \rho ), not (A). Since the derivative of the log determinant with respect to (A), the full laplacian matrix, is an (N \times N) matrix, I was getting a conformality error in PyMC3, which wanted the derivative with respect to $\rho$ and was expecting a scalar.</description>

      <description>Recently, I’ve been working on getting spatial econometric models implemented using PyMC3. I’ll put pu an example later, but right now I’m primarily concerned with making the example more efficient for slightly larger datasets.
You see, some spatial econometric models require that the log determinant of a very large matrix be computed. Since most of these models are estimated using Maximum Likelihood, this is somewhat painful, but can be minimized by exploiting sparsity in the large matrix.</description>

      <description>This is a visualization of one hierarchical parameter from a a spatially-varying coefficient process model, estimated on a simple 10x10 grid. The model itself is a pretty neat way to specify a spatially-varying process with an efficient formal structure. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the specification here, but my growing interest in MLM/HLM means I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be posting about SVCP-style models more frequently.
The point of this, though, is that characterizing both the spatial distribution of hierarchical parameter means and the distributions of those parameters for each individual unit is hard.</description>

      <description>North Carolina voters are likely to be confused when they arrive at the polling place on March 15th. In addition to presidential candidates, voters will see congressional primary candidates on the ballot.
But thanks to a federal court decision, the districts those candidates represent no longer exist and any voters in those races won’t count.
Thanks to three judges, two animal shapes and one hastily redrawn map of U.</description>

These kinds of maps are interesting visualizations, but I guarantee you that these maps would exhibit such strong partisan &amp;amp; racial bias.

      <description>The speed differences between Scipy and Numpy&amp;rsquo;s probability distributions is immense. Across the board, we see that numpy is almost twice as fast, in all cases. In the worst case, it&amp;rsquo;s hundreds of times faster. I wish scipy would put a warning or something on usage, cause waiting for some of these simulations I actually need to finish will be ridiculous.

At the top, the voronoi polygons for the North Carolina CD centroids are calculated at an 80% buffer distance. This means that the algorithm is trying to extend the voronoi polygons out to 80% of the minimum bounding rectangle.
But, if you know things about voronoi polygons, you know that they</description>

      <description>Also, I was informed that monokai soda, my terminal color scheme, is &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo; by someone who uses solarized light.
I guess color scheme fights are about as lame as you can get. Except maybe fights over brace or comment styles&amp;hellip;

      <description>GeoDa center sandbox? Super cool. And yet, it&amp;rsquo;s been long defunct. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what happens sometimes when things don&amp;rsquo;t hit critical mass.
Hopefully the things I&amp;rsquo;m contributing to won&amp;rsquo;t fall similarly by the wayside.

      <description>That aside, I&amp;rsquo;ve forked the Shapefile.jl repo and put in some goals to further Julia&amp;rsquo;s spatial analysis capabilities. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the community ethics/practices are for Julia, but I&amp;rsquo;m always slightly nervous about being the first fork on a repo that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been touched in a few months. I can&amp;rsquo;t really explain why. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a concern that my preference for private repos and anonymous contribution makes my github page look sparse.</description>

      <title>first simple program in julia- a greedy knapsack</title>

      <description>A couple realizations:
1.) Having learned R first, I&amp;rsquo;m continually disappointed when standard arrays don&amp;rsquo;t implement sorting well.
2.) I wanted to implement this using a queue, but apparently those aren&amp;rsquo;t standard elements in Julia&amp;rsquo;s base. And, for some reason, Julia&amp;rsquo;s package/module interface wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. Their explanation is cryptic on how to import functions from modules made out of installed packages, and what the relationship is between modules and packages.</description>

      <description>I simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t as efficient with others as I was with workflowy. The ease of use, the speed, the interface&amp;hellip; all superior for just a simple outlining tool.
It&amp;rsquo;s not open source, but it&amp;rsquo;s so well designed. This kills me.
If I could get HackFlowy working with tags and external port forwarding, I would leave. But, for now, I&amp;rsquo;l consign myself to the proprietary beast.

      <description>High expectations (by myself and those around me) increase stakes. I have an idea of where the line is between &amp;ldquo;ready to ship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;needs more edits&amp;rdquo; without needing hard deadlines, but need more worldly experience. Writing this article is quite different than the work I did as a research assistant at the Office of the President, with Dr. Clay or Dr. Bruhn, or for the various campaigns and social movements I worked with.</description>
