      <description>The smallest little errors give you some pretty weird results when you&amp;rsquo;re looking deeply into the data. In this case, Doug Bosco only ran against David Redick. Creighton and Binderup were oppononents of another Democrat that year, the then-congresswoman now-senator Barbara Boxer.
