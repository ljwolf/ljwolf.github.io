      <description>Photo Caption: So, say you&amp;rsquo;re working with two state&amp;rsquo;s congressional data. All of it&amp;rsquo;s been cleaned and made through a list comprehension and write statement in python using pandas. Then, you have to read it into R because JudgeIt is only an R package so far. All the dataframes were made in the same way, yet R decided that indicators of California&amp;rsquo;s 112th districts were factors, not numbers, causing JudgeIt sanity checks to fail.</description>
