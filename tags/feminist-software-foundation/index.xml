      <description>I usually don’t think much about credentialization online. I have a few internet aliases (like yetanothergeographer) that I consider almost totally synonymous with my real name and persona. And even other personas on tumblr or other social networking sites are easily traced back to my “full” identity.
But, something that I found pretty shocking recently was the fact that any github profile you can find shows your public ssh keys to everyone.</description>
