      <description>I looked into using spatial autocorrelation functions in my dissertation to characterize the ``scale&amp;rdquo; at which processes operate electorally. I did an analysis of presidential vote by county, trying to identify where, exactly, clusters of votes tend to become decorrelated. The typical diameter at which the so-called &amp;ldquo;spatial autocorrelation function&amp;rdquo; goes to zero denotes how wide a typical spatial cluster might be, and the partial spatial autocorrelation function gives an anticipated order at which spatial autocorrelation may hold.</description>

      <title>A short exploration of the 2016 electoral swing</title>

      <description>I’m pretty skeptical of the generalized uniform partisan swing assumption in gerrymandering models. Part of this is due to some skepticism about how swing actually occurs in elections generally. If we don’t have an explicit “shock” model for our counterfactuals, they’re probably not going to replicate true experienced electoral swings well. 
I’ve put together a notebook where I go through and explore some modeling of the 2012-2016 electoral swing at the county level.</description>

      <description>Elections, Bayes, and one realization about the Gelman-King Model People make a lot of hay out of the rise of Nate Silver and Bayesian poll averaging when it comes to the rise of data-driven electoral prediction and analysis. When it comes to data-driven politics, these methods are pretty neat. But, they&amp;rsquo;re based on very old understandings of statistics which, in the right light, seem quite intuitive. Gelman-King (1994)&amp;rsquo;s model Say, for instance, we&amp;rsquo;re examining some vector of electoral outcomes, (y) given some predictor matrix (\mathbf{X}).</description>
