      <description>I usually don’t think much about credentialization online. I have a few internet aliases (like yetanothergeographer) that I consider almost totally synonymous with my real name and persona. And even other personas on tumblr or other social networking sites are easily traced back to my “full” identity.
But, something that I found pretty shocking recently was the fact that any github profile you can find shows your public ssh keys to everyone.</description>

      <description>Finally landed on my feet in the upstairs of a cozy duplex in Bernal Heights, waiting for my &amp;ldquo;onboarding&amp;rdquo; for Nextdoor after Memorial Day. So far, everything&amp;rsquo;s been nice. I was worried I&amp;rsquo;d be living in a very yuppie neighborhood, but, at first brush, Bernal Heights seems to have held onto a sense of localness.
Which brings me to the question of how to answer &amp;ldquo;Are you local?&amp;rdquo; I heard this asked to a few people today, eavesdropping across bars and coffeeshops during my first day of urban orienteering.</description>
