      <description>This discussion by Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs is a must read. Like usual, I think Nathan&amp;rsquo;s exactly right.
But first, a little personal digression. None of this is about statistics or data science at all, so if you&amp;rsquo;re here for that, feel free to tune out.
This past year has been a personal &amp;amp; professional whirlwind for me. Over its course, I broke up with my long-term girlfriend, sold/donated nearly everything I owned, moved to Brooklyn to work for CARTO while finishing my dissertation, got back with my girlfriend long distance from Brooklyn, applied to (and got) a tenure-track job in the UK, then finished my dissertation, moved to the UK, defended my dissertation, and returned here to try and stop my head from spinning.</description>
