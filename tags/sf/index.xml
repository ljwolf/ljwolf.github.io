      <description>Finally landed on my feet in the upstairs of a cozy duplex in Bernal Heights, waiting for my &amp;ldquo;onboarding&amp;rdquo; for Nextdoor after Memorial Day. So far, everything&amp;rsquo;s been nice. I was worried I&amp;rsquo;d be living in a very yuppie neighborhood, but, at first brush, Bernal Heights seems to have held onto a sense of localness.
Which brings me to the question of how to answer &amp;ldquo;Are you local?&amp;rdquo; I heard this asked to a few people today, eavesdropping across bars and coffeeshops during my first day of urban orienteering.</description>
