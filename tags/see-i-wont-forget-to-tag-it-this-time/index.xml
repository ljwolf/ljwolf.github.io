      <description>After a bit of a whirlwind, going to SciPy and then relocating to Chicago for a bit, I figure I&amp;rsquo;ve collected enough thoughts to update on my summer of code project, as well as some of the discussion we&amp;rsquo;ve had in the library recently.
I&amp;rsquo;ve actually seen a lot of feedback on quite a bit of my postings since my post on handling burnout as a graduate student. But, I&amp;rsquo;ve been forgetting to tag posts so that they&amp;rsquo;d show up in the GSOC aggregator!</description>
