      <description>If you haven’t read/paid attention to the Numpy Governance Discussions goingon in the numpy discussion mailing list, I wouldn’t blame you. They’re probably dry and boring.
But, for me, as someone who has been involved in a few Free/Open source communities over the past 8 years, I’m sensing a very interesting divide in the Numpy discussion (and FOSS Python more broadly) that I think is presented more strongly there than I’ve seen it elsewhere.</description>
