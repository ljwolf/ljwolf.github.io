      <description>Photo Caption: It&amp;rsquo;s neat that this new algorithm is working correctly. Here, a few cluster solutions for spatially-contiguous clustering are shown in Brooklyn using some price data for some Airbnbs. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about this new technique, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get it all prepped soon.
I find that the hardest part for me to be motivated about is the stage right after I finish the proof of concept. It&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;hellip; once the new stuff is done, I get much less interested than when I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to figure it out.</description>
