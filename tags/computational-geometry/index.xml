      <description>My dissertation is on gerrymandering. While I’m very sure it’s not the best way to do it, many people use geometric measures of district shapes as a way to detect gerrymandering. 
One of the oldest and most well-used is the Reock measure, first developed in 1960. It’s a bit tougher than other kinds of gerrymandering measures to construct. For instance, the most popular measure is the Polsby-Popper measure, as used in this Washinton Post piece, is actually identical to a shape measure calle the Isoperimetric Quotient.</description>
