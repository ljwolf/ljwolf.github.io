      <description> Photo Caption: OK&amp;hellip; so I think my days of using texstudio are over. Vim-latex&amp;rsquo;s reference manager is leaps and bounds easier to use than texsudio.
Also, I was informed that monokai soda, my terminal color scheme, is &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo; by someone who uses solarized light.
I guess color scheme fights are about as lame as you can get. Except maybe fights over brace or comment styles&amp;hellip;

      <description> Photo Caption: It&amp;rsquo;s so frustrating to see a cool idea fall by the wayside. GeoDa center sandbox? Super cool. And yet, it&amp;rsquo;s been long defunct. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what happens sometimes when things don&amp;rsquo;t hit critical mass.
Hopefully the things I&amp;rsquo;m contributing to won&amp;rsquo;t fall similarly by the wayside.
