      <description>My dissertation is on gerrymandering. While I’m very sure it’s not the best way to do it, many people use geometric measures of district shapes as a way to detect gerrymandering. 
One of the oldest and most well-used is the Reock measure, first developed in 1960. It’s a bit tougher than other kinds of gerrymandering measures to construct. For instance, the most popular measure is the Polsby-Popper measure, as used in this Washinton Post piece, is actually identical to a shape measure calle the Isoperimetric Quotient.</description>

      <description>The more that I work with broad datasets, collected from many different means and used in many different contexts, the more I think that you really only need the &amp;ldquo;multi&amp;rdquo; instantiation of polygons, lines, and points. Usually, due to database typecasting, you want to coerce any heterogeneous datatypes into the same datatype. Since it&amp;rsquo;s much simpler to cast Polygons upwards into MultiPolygons, I&amp;rsquo;m rarely seeing any Polygons or Lines, even in datasets where the majority of features are single-component.</description>
