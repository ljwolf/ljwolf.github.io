      <description>I looked into using spatial autocorrelation functions in my dissertation to characterize the ``scale&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; at which processes operate electorally. I did an analysis of presidential vote by county, trying to identify where, exactly, clusters of votes tend to become decorrelated. The typical diameter at which the so-called &amp;ldquo;spatial autocorrelation function&amp;rdquo; goes to zero denotes how wide a typical spatial cluster might be, and the partial spatial autocorrelation function gives an anticipated order at which spatial autocorrelation may hold.</description>
