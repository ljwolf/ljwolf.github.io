      <description>Photo Caption: A fun little bug in my apparently outdated QGIS (version 2.2).
I am in the process of matching North Carolina congressional districts (CD) to their corresponding voronoi polygons drawn from the CD centroids.
At the top, the voronoi polygons for the North Carolina CD centroids are calculated at an 80% buffer distance. This means that the algorithm is trying to extend the voronoi polygons out to 80% of the minimum bounding rectangle.</description>

      <description>Photo Caption: Went crawling back into workflowy&amp;rsquo;s arms today after a vailiant year-long experiment in other organizing systems.
I simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t as efficient with others as I was with workflowy. The ease of use, the speed, the interface&amp;hellip; all superior for just a simple outlining tool.
It&amp;rsquo;s not open source, but it&amp;rsquo;s so well designed. This kills me.
If I could get HackFlowy working with tags and external port forwarding, I would leave.</description>
