      <description>My dissertation is on gerrymandering. While I’m very sure it’s not the best way to do it, many people use geometric measures of district shapes as a way to detect gerrymandering. 
One of the oldest and most well-used is the Reock measure, first developed in 1960. It’s a bit tougher than other kinds of gerrymandering measures to construct. For instance, the most popular measure is the Polsby-Popper measure, as used in this Washinton Post piece, is actually identical to a shape measure calle the Isoperimetric Quotient.</description>

      <description>I feel like there are two big, “pivotal” realizations in my story so far of learning to program. While I’m sure not everyone moves from Haskell to Shen to R to Python before really feeling competent in a language, I have seen many peers grapple with them. 
1. Separate your code and data. I think this would be more aptly stated as Think Abstractly, but that belies the immediacy that the first statement provides.</description>
