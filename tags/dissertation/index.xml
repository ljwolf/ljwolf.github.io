      <description>I looked into using spatial autocorrelation functions in my dissertation to characterize the ``scale&amp;rdquo; at which processes operate electorally. I did an analysis of presidential vote by county, trying to identify where, exactly, clusters of votes tend to become decorrelated. The typical diameter at which the so-called &amp;ldquo;spatial autocorrelation function&amp;rdquo; goes to zero denotes how wide a typical spatial cluster might be, and the partial spatial autocorrelation function gives an anticipated order at which spatial autocorrelation may hold.</description>

      <description>District shape isn’t at all related to political impact (in aggregate) when it comes to redistricting.
While some weird districts may exist and those may be gerrymandered, the relationship is not statistically sound in aggregate: weird districts might be completely benign, in terms of the partisan advantage measures I’m considereding my dissertation &amp;amp; other classical measures of model influence.
Totally discounting the “expressive harms” arguments in this sphere, though.</description>

      <description>finally got this elections simulator working, based on Linzer&amp;rsquo;s 2012 paper on gaussian mixture modelling for elections data.
