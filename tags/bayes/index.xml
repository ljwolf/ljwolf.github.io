Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s up, but it&amp;rsquo;s not good&amp;hellip;

      <description>have really bad traces sometimes&amp;hellip;. not sure what causes them to do this excursion out into the weird space, but it makes their eventual traces have real severe autocorrelation.

      <description>Elections, Bayes, and one realization about the Gelman-King Model People make a lot of hay out of the rise of Nate Silver and Bayesian poll averaging when it comes to the rise of data-driven electoral prediction and analysis. When it comes to data-driven politics, these methods are pretty neat. But, they&amp;rsquo;re based on very old understandings of statistics which, in the right light, seem quite intuitive. Gelman-King (1994)&amp;rsquo;s model Say, for instance, we&amp;rsquo;re examining some vector of electoral outcomes, (y) given some predictor matrix (\mathbf{X}).</description>
