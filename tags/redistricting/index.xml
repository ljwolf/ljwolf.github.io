      <description>For a while, I was really interested in writing this article, “strange as it ever was,” looking at whether geometric measures of district compactness are really worse nowadays than they were before the use of computer redistricting. And, while I can’t say that the development of computers did this, I’d be willing to bet that the aggregated decline is more related to the introduction of strict population constraints.  imported from: yetanothergeographer</description>
