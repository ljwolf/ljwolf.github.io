      <description>If you’ve been using my tools for census data exploration, as intensely as I&amp;rsquo;d hope you have, you might’ve noticed that the Census limits queries to 50 columns per query.
I’ve got your back, though. The newest release, cenpy 0.7, now supports n-column queries by chunking through 50-coulumns at a time. Be careful, though, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you pull down the entire Census 2010 short form in one go, you will probably get rate limited.</description>

      <description>You know, I like all this math and engineering material I&amp;rsquo;m enrolled in, and I&amp;rsquo;m not too bad at it. But it&amp;rsquo;s fairly frustrating listening to engineers talk about systems where this material gets applied as if they&amp;rsquo;re fully generic.I&amp;rsquo;m starting to hit that point where the divisions between physical and natural systems are creeping in.
Flashbacks to my decision to study political science and not Industrial Engineering are becoming more and more common.</description>
