      <description>Python’s got some pretty cool ways to enable unorthodox behavior. For my project, I’ve found myself writing a lot of closures around our existing class init functions, and have decided it might be easier &amp;amp; more consistent to express this as what it really is: partial application. Partial application is pretty simple to enable for python class constructors, since the separate new method allows you to construct closures around initialization routines.</description>
