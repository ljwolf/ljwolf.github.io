      <description>So, maybe this is part of the learning experience of developing applied intuition, but I never really appreciated how important it is to center your variables, especially when dealing with finicky models like simultaneous autoregressive models common in spatial econometrics.
The following are three traces from a spatial econometric model, the spatial lag model, on some example data. 
The first one hasn’t centered its variables. The lag coefficient is trying very hard to escape the (-1,1) bounding on stable autoregressive coefficients.</description>
