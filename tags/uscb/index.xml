      <description> Photo Caption: That compression is bewilderingly good. The full census short form at block level (generated using a static file reader soon-to-be in cenpy) can be compressed from nearly 60 GB down to 3.1 GB.
Simply amazing.

      <description>If you’ve been using my tools for census data exploration, as intensely as I&amp;rsquo;d hope you have, you might’ve noticed that the Census limits queries to 50 columns per query.
I’ve got your back, though. The newest release, cenpy 0.7, now supports n-column queries by chunking through 50-coulumns at a time. Be careful, though, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you pull down the entire Census 2010 short form in one go, you will probably get rate limited.</description>
