      <description>Clarifying a Core Data Model for PySAL  Gist here From my perspective, I see my proposal for GSOC as containing two oblique foci. My hope in drafting this notebook for my fellow authors is to make this clear.
I think at this point, many people who use &amp;amp; develop PySAL would like to see better tooling for Pandas$\leftrightarrow$PySAL interaction. This was started by Luc, Dani, &amp;amp; myself in the pysal.</description>

      <description>As a way to learn Python (and I mean really come to know it), I took on the project of converting PySAL to be compatible with Python 3.
I started work on this two years ago. A tentative candidate for release is available in my fork
Now, Iâ€™m glad I did this. I still worry about the day when Apple decides to ship the next OSX (Half Moon Bay? Big Sur?</description>

      <description>For my TA appointment for the Masters in Applied Sciences program, I am having to generate some lectures on statistical theory. Because of some interest across the program in improving the statistics portion of the curriculum, I wrote about two weeks of lectures and assignments on spatial statistics, pushing from a start point of the Kolmogorov Axioms, fundamental results in elementary probability theory all the way up through spatial regression.</description>

      <description>That aside, I&amp;rsquo;ve forked the Shapefile.jl repo and put in some goals to further Julia&amp;rsquo;s spatial analysis capabilities. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the community ethics/practices are for Julia, but I&amp;rsquo;m always slightly nervous about being the first fork on a repo that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been touched in a few months. I can&amp;rsquo;t really explain why. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a concern that my preference for private repos and anonymous contribution makes my github page look sparse.</description>
