      <description>The more that I work with broad datasets, collected from many different means and used in many different contexts, the more I think that you really only need the &amp;ldquo;multi&amp;rdquo; instantiation of polygons, lines, and points. Usually, due to database typecasting, you want to coerce any heterogeneous datatypes into the same datatype. Since it&amp;rsquo;s much simpler to cast Polygons upwards into MultiPolygons, I&amp;rsquo;m rarely seeing any Polygons or Lines, even in datasets where the majority of features are single-component.</description>
