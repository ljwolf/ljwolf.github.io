      <description>Photo Caption: I guess this is how productivity works? Terminal sessions and web browsers. Seems like nothing else is needed nowadays. Though, I guess the guys over at LightTable would beg to disagree. I tried LightTable today for some LaTeX stuff. Seems like a brilliant tool there, if things like LyX or TexStudio didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. TexStudio in particular, my choice of LaTeX editor, does a wonderful job showing the structure of the workspace in one cohesive, intuitive way.</description>
