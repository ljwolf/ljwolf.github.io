      <description>I wrote a little guide for my fellow library devs about how to use soft dependencies effectively. This moves in tandem with some work on enabling PySAL to have a consistent user experience while leveraging the newest &amp;amp; best libraries for scientific computation. Since most of the work I’ve been doing involves using soft dependencies with the library, it’s important to get this right. The gist is here.

      <title>GSOC Call Notes, June 6 2016</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to take a break from the spatial hierarchical linear modeling kick I&amp;rsquo;ve been on recently to get back to some GSOC work.
Today, I had my weekly call with my mentors.
On today&amp;rsquo;s call, my mentors and I discussed a few things.
Testing &amp;amp; Merging of project code Since many of the improvements I&amp;rsquo;m making to the library are module-by-module, I was advised to submit PRs when a logical unit of contribution is ready to ship.</description>

      <title>The Beginnings of a new API</title>

      <description>NOTE: A demo of the relevant code I&amp;rsquo;m referring to for the new labelled array API in pysal.weights in this update is available in this notebook, and the actual code lives in a weights2 module in my gsoc feature branch.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to target our weights module to prototype the labelled array interface. In general, we&amp;rsquo;ll need extensions built into at least our exploratory spatial data analysis module, esda, our spatial regression module, spreg, and our spatial dynamics module, spatial_dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reflections on a hard-won win for PySAL</title>

      <description>As a way to learn Python (and I mean really come to know it), I took on the project of converting PySAL to be compatible with Python 3.
I started work on this two years ago. A tentative candidate for release is available in my fork
Now, I’m glad I did this. I still worry about the day when Apple decides to ship the next OSX (Half Moon Bay? Big Sur?</description>

      <title>Voronoi Gripes</title>

      <description>Wow, did not expect this to be as big of an issue as it has been.
Pysal removed the code for generating voronoi diagrams for the standard library. Not sure why.
Instead, on the mailing list, the project BDFL provides code for a diagram of randomized points.
Adapting this, I should be good. Though, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask why it was dropped from pysal.core or pysal.cg.
