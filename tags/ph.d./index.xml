      <description>So, having just completed our welcome weekend for prospective Ph.D. students, I think I might have suggestions for anyone going to one in the future.
1. Try to have fun. It can be a wild, stressful, busy few days. But, above all, you should be trying to figure how much you like the people you&amp;rsquo;re with.
2. Balance breadth and depth. Yes, you may want to work with only a few people, but departments are communities.</description>
