      <description>Photo Caption: This is an interesting little exploration I did while finishing up my GISRUK data challenge analysis. It&amp;rsquo;s not going into my analysis, but I like the concept, so I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here (cause that&amp;rsquo;s the entire point of this blog!)
I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a good idea for what many places in the UK are like, nor for what the structure of some of this data is when considering its joint structure.</description>
